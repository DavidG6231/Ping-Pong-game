# Ping-Pong-game

The ping-pong game is a Pong inspired game made with the Pygame module in Python. It uses the up and down arrow keys to control the rackets which hit the ball from one side to another. If the ball touches the right or left side of the screen, you lose.

The ball can bounce on the bottom on the top of the screen safely, and you need to save it from touching the left or right side of the screen by moving the rackets infront of it. This makes the game chellenging, as you have to control two rackets at the same time to not lose.
